My name is José Dutra 👨🏽‍💻

I worked at The Brazilian Army Forces as a Sergeant for
the past 16 years. However, my passion for programming has got me
following a new career change as a Frontend Developer. My interest in
programming languages, such as JavaScript, drove me to specializing
currently in Frontend Development.
